Immersive stereo sound, splash and water resistant, and iOS 10. The iPhone 7 display uses the same color space as the digital cinema industry, so what you see will be noticeably more brilliant and vibrant. When you use 3D Touch, your iPhone responds with subtle taps. The new Retina HD display deeply integrates 3D Touch throughout iOS. Now you can interact with Messages, Calendar, Mail, and other apps. We’ve reengineered that beloved camera, adding optical image stabilization, an ƒ/1.8 aperture, and a six-element lens to make it even better for shooting photos and videos in low light. And with advanced new features like wide color capture, your photos and Live Photos will look even more vibrant. With its entire enclosure reengineered, it is the very first water resistant iPhone. iPhone 7 is supercharged by the most powerful chip ever in a smartphone. It’s not just faster than any previous iPhone, it’s also more efficient. It enables faster processing when you need it and the ability to use even less power when you don’t. And with the longest battery life ever in an iPhone, you can work at twice the speed of iPhone 6 and still enjoy more time.",
